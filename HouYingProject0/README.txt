How to compile and run the program:

This is a Java program.

To compile it, change to the directory where the source code Project0.java lives, and use “javac Project0.java”. 
Or, be in any directory you want, and use “javac <path of Project0.java from current directory>”.

To run the program, use “java Project0 <path of the input file>”, if you are in the src folder. The program 
accepts one command line argument, which is the path of the input file that you want to be processed. 


Functionality:

The output file <filename>.out will be in the same directory and have the same filename as the input file. 

It will remove blank lines and leading white space in the input file. Besides, it will remove all comments, 
both // comments and /*…*/ comments.
