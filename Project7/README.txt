How to compile and run this program:

This is a Java program.

To compile it, be in the src directory where the source code lives, and run "javac *.java".

To run the program, be in the src directory and use "java Project7 <path of the input .vm file>". The program
accepts one command line argument, which is the path of the input file that you want to be translated.


Functionality:

This program is the first part of the Virtual Machine Language Translator, focusing on the implementation of the stack arithmetic 
and memory access commands of the VM language. It reads in a .vm file and translates it into a .asm file.
The output file <filename>.asm will be in the same directory and have the same filename as the input file.
